\section{Hydropower}

Hydropower is power taken out from the potential or kinetic energy of water, which may be harnessed for useful purposes. It has been used throughout history, from the first watermills used in Syria around 2\textsuperscript{nd} century BC \cite{reynolds} to irrigate or activate mechanical devices, to the modern day electrical production plants. The first use of hydroelectricity dates back to 1878 in England \cite{indus_arch}, and commercial use appeared in the USA in 1881. By 1920 hydropower accounted for \unit[25]{\%} of the US electricity generation \cite{hist_hyd}. \newline
Currently,  \unit[27]{\%}  of the \unit[1171]{GW} of hydropower installed in the world is  in China, \unit[10]{\%} in Canada, and \unit[9]{\%} in Brazil. Norway leads the world with \unit[96]{\%} domestic electricity generation \cite{iea_stat}. Figure \ref{world_hp} shows the evolution of hydroelectricity production in the world over the last 50 years. The production, originally based mainly in OECD countries, has quadrupled in 50 years due to the development of hydropower in China and non OECD Americas.

In Europe hydropower is the largest renewable energy resource, accounting for \unit[18]{\%} of total electricity generation. However, the potential for hydropower generation depends on geographic and climatic conditions, and capacity is concentrated in several distinct regions (the Nordic countries, the Alps, the Iberian Peninsula and Turkey) \cite{hp_europe}. \newline
Hydroelectric production in Germany is mostly concentrated in the south and west (Bayern, Baden-Württemberg, Rheinland Pfalz, North Rhine-Westphalia), as shown in Fig. \ref{hp_de}, based on the Open Power Data Set. In 2014, it accounted for \unit[12]{\%} of the renewable electricity production in Germany, with around \unit[20]{TWh} produced (reservoir plants, run-of-the-river plants, as well as production from natural inflow in pumped storage plants) \cite{bdew}.

Reservoir hydropower plants have negative social and environmental impacts because of the changes brought by the construction of dams and reservoirs. These structures change the ecosystem, both aquatic and terrestrial, by flooding areas, destroying wildlife habitat, and changing or blocking the water flow. Reservoirs also occupy large areas and sometimes require entire communities to be relocated. Most new projects must undergo an environmental and social impact assessment to oversee, prevent or compensate the negative impacts. Run-of-the-river power plants, in contrast to reservoir plants, have a much smaller impact on the ecosystem and society because they do not require water impoundment. The dams are often equipped with fish ladders and fish protection facilities, in order to help wildlife circulation. \newline 
Hydropower presents many advantages for a transition to a more sustainable energy system: it does not require fossil fuels in the operating phase, it has a very low life cycle GHG emissions (see Fig. \ref{ghg_em}), and it is available on a commercial scale at competitive costs \cite{hp_europe}. For this reason, it has to be taken into account in transition scenarios and energy system models.

\section{Energy systems modelling}

In the past decades, the need for an energy transition has emerged. This need has been acknowledged in the sustainable development goals \cite{un_sdgs} set by the United Nations, in particular ``affordable and clean energy'' (goals 7) \cite{un_sdg7} and ``sustainable cities and communities'' (goal 11) \cite{un_sdg11}. However, a successful energy transition will have a positive impact on other development goals as well, through a reduction of pollution, global warming, and conflicts about the access to fossil fuels. \newline

Energy transition is made possible by replacing conventional fuels such as coal, gas or uranium by renewable energy sources, such as wind, sunlight, water, biomass or geothermal energy. These energy sources are harnessed on site and the site potential is highly dependent on weather, landscape relief, as well as time of year or day. This leads to a more complex decentralized and intermittent energy production compared to conventional power plants. \newline
Production irregularity and strong dependence on weather results in an energy supply that is not controllable and cannot always meet demand. Furthermore, variability in the potential of each type of renewable energy, depending on the site, requires an adjustment of the energy system from site to site. This prompts the need for reliable energy systems modelling to simulate and optimize the energy mix, distribution network, and energy management of a given region. Energy systems simulation requires good quality energy conversion and distribution models, consistent data about the weather, the existing plants in the region, and the energy demand, and robust optimization tools.


\section{Open source and open data}

The volume of renewable energy research has grown during the last decades. More than 180 university and 120 non-university research institutes are conducting research about energy transition in Germany alone \cite{bmbf_energiewende}. Models and data sets for energy systems are being developed by various actors of the energy sector. Model complexity has also increased, requiring specialists of different fields to work together (geographers, meteorologists, energy specialists, economists, sociologists, …). However, the tools and data basis themselves are rarely made public which forces different actors to waste time, money and energy developing the same models and gathering the same data. \newline

The Open Energy Modelling initiative (Openmod) was launched in September 2014 by several researchers in Germany and abroad \cite{openmod_workshop} to address this problem and promote open energy modelling in Europe. This initiative strives for open science in all its forms: open source software and hardware, open data, open access to publications, open peer review, open educational resources and open methodology about all of these aspects. It states that ``more openness in energy modelling will increase transparency and credibility, reduce wasteful double-work and improve overall quality`` \cite{openmod_manifesto}. \newline
The Reiner Lemoine institute has been part of this initiative since the beginning and  carries out several projects of open energy modelling, such as oemof (open energy system modelling framework \cite{rli_oemof}), open\_eGo (open electricity grid optimization \cite{rli_openego}) and open\_FRED (open feed-in time series based on a renewable energy database \cite{rli_openfred}). 

\section{Aim and structure of the thesis}
This work is part of the open\_FRED project, which aims at creating and making available consistent standard data of all relevant data sets (power plant registers, adjusted climate data, and basic data such as river networks or administrative boundaries), and developing compatible open source simulations models, which will produce feed-in time series of fluctuating renewable energies. \newline
Given the important part of hydropower in the European energy mix, the low life cycle GHG emissions of hydropower, and the limited environmental and social impacts of run-of-the-river hydroelectricity, a set of renewable energy models would not be complete without a model for run-of-the-river electricity production. \newline
This thesis tackles the issue of modelling and simulating electricity generation from run-of-the-river hydroelectric power plants based on open access geodatabases. It aims at developing an open-source Python model able to simulate time series of the electrical output of one or several run-of-the-river power plants based on open source data sets of power plants, weather, and river discharge. \\
Chapter \ref{chap:basics} will focus on the basic principles of hydropower, and present a state of the art of technology and research in this domain. Chapter \ref{chap:data_basis} will list the necessary and available data sets about hydropower. Chapter \ref{chap:methodology} will present a methodology adapted to the available data in order to develop the model introduced in Ch. \ref{chap:simulation_model}. Finally, the results of the model will be presented in Ch. \ref{chap:results} and discussed in Ch. \ref{chap:discussion}.
