def get_dV_n(self):
    r"""
    Get value for dV_n, the nominal water flow through the turbine. 
    If P_n and h_n are known, dV_n is calculated through equation P_n=h_n*dV_n*g*rho*eta_g_n*eta_t_n
    Where g=9.81 m/s2, rho=1000 kg/m3, eta_g_n (nominal generator efficiency)=0.95 and eta_t_n (nominal turbine efficiency)=0.9
    Otherwise dV_n is calculated from the flow duration curve over several years, after subtracting dV_rest.
    It is the water flow reached or exceeded 20% of the time.
